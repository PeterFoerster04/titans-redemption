TITAN'S REDEMPTION:

A 3D Sci-Fi low poly style 3rd Person speeder chase game, with the mission to scout, chase, 
and hunt down alien criminals through the futuristic city’s aerial streets, working for the space police.

I completed this project in ten weeks, which included creating all the necessary assets. 
It was part of my studies a Diploma degree in Game Programming at SAE.
I used this project to learn Unreal Engine, using C++and Blueprints.
Blender is used to create all the low poly assets, 
while the particle systems and VFX are produced through Unreal Engine's Niagara System. 
The majority of the sounds used were sourced from the GDC sound library.

Project Highlights:

A custom 3D Nav-Mesh Generation was necessary to enable AI to navigate through the City,
as Unreal did not offer any solution for 3D pathfinding. To escape, 
the criminals utilize A-Star pathfinding to navigate the custom 3D Nav-Mesh.
The Niagara particle system is used to simulate flying vehicles that are not involved in the chase, 
in order to improve performance.
The case files provide information about the targeted criminals, the mission objectives,
and the rewards that will be given upon completion.
Tailor your aircraft's abilities to match the objectives by selecting the appropriate equipment and armaments.
